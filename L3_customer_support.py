# ## Role Playing, Focus and Cooperation

# In[21]:


support_agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Support Representative",
    goal="Be the most friendly and helpful "
         "support representative in your team",
    backstory=(
        "You work at EIGSI and "
        "are now working on providing "
        "support to {customer}, a super important customer "
        "for your company. "
        "You need to make sure that you provide the best support! "
        "Make sure to provide full complete answers, "
        "and make no assumptions."
    ),
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True
)


# - By not setting `allow_delegation=False`, `allow_delegation` takes its default value of being `True`.
# - This means the agent _can_ delegate its work to another agent which is better suited to do a particular task. 

# In[22]:


support_quality_assurance_agent = Agent(
    role="Support Quality Assurance Specialist",
    goal="Get recognition for providing the "
         "best support quality assurance in your team",
    backstory=(
        "You work at EIGSI and "
        "are now working with your team "
        "on a request from {customer} ensuring that "
        "the support representative is "
        "providing the best support possible.\n"
        "You need to make sure that the support representative "
        "is providing full "
        "complete answers, and make no assumptions."
    ),
    verbose=True
)


# * **Role Playing**: Both agents have been given a role, goal and backstory.
# * **Focus**: Both agents have been prompted to get into the character of the roles they are playing.
# * **Cooperation**: Support Quality Assurance Agent can delegate work back to the Support Agent, allowing for these agents to work together.

# ## Tools, Guardrails and Memory
# 
# ### Tools

# - Import CrewAI tools

# In[23]:


from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, \
                         ScrapeWebsiteTool, \
                         WebsiteSearchTool


# ### Possible Custom Tools
# - Load customer data
# - Tap into previous conversations
# - Load data from a CRM
# - Checking existing bug reports
# - Checking existing feature requests
# - Checking ongoing tickets
# - ... and more

# - Some ways of using CrewAI tools.
# 
# ```Python
# search_tool = SerperDevTool()
# scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
# ```

# - Instantiate a document scraper tool.
# - The tool will scrape a page (only 1 URL) of the CrewAI documentation.

# In[24]:


docs_scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool(
    website_url="https://www.eigsi.fr/"
)


# ##### Different Ways to Give Agents Tools
# 
# - Agent Level: The Agent can use the Tool(s) on any Task it performs.
# - Task Level: The Agent will only use the Tool(s) when performing that specific Task.
# 
# **Note**: Task Tools override the Agent Tools.

# ### Creating Tasks
# - You are passing the Tool on the Task Level.

# In[25]:


inquiry_resolution = Task(
    description=(
        "{customer} just reached out with a super important ask:\n"
        "{inquiry}\n\n"
        "{person} from {customer} is the one that reached out. "
        "Make sure to use everything you know "
        "to provide the best support possible. "
        "You must strive to provide a complete "
        "and accurate response to the customer's inquiry."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "A detailed, informative response to the "
        "customer's inquiry that addresses "
        "all aspects of their question.\n"
        "The response should include references "
        "to everything you used to find the answer, "
        "including external data or solutions. "
        "Ensure the answer is complete, "
        "leaving no questions unanswered, and maintain a helpful and friendly "
        "tone throughout."
    ),
    tools=[docs_scrape_tool],
    agent=support_agent,
)


# - `quality_assurance_review` is not using any Tool(s)
# - Here the QA Agent will only review the work of the Support Agent

# In[26]:


quality_assurance_review = Task(
    description=(
        "Review the response drafted by the Senior Support Representative for {customer}'s inquiry. "
        "Ensure that the answer is comprehensive, accurate, and adheres to the "
        "high-quality standards expected for customer support.\n"
        "Verify that all parts of the customer's inquiry "
        "have been addressed "
        "thoroughly, with a helpful and friendly tone.\n"
        "Check for references and sources used to "
        "find the information, "
        "ensuring the response is well-supported and "
        "leaves no questions unanswered."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "A final, detailed, and informative response "
        "ready to be sent to the customer.\n"
        "This response should fully address the "
        "customer's inquiry, incorporating all "
        "relevant feedback and improvements.\n"
        "Don't be too formal, we are a chill and cool company "
        "but maintain a professional and friendly tone throughout."
    ),
    agent=support_quality_assurance_agent,
)


# ### Creating the Crew
# 
# #### Memory
# - Setting `memory=True` when putting the crew together enables Memory.

# In[27]:


crew = Crew(
  agents=[support_agent, support_quality_assurance_agent],
  tasks=[inquiry_resolution, quality_assurance_review],
  verbose=2,
  memory=True
)


# ### Running the Crew
# 
# **Note**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.
# 
# #### Guardrails
# - By running the execution below, you can see that the agents and the responses are within the scope of what we expect from them.

# In[28]:


inputs = {
    "customer": "EIGSI",
    "person": "Romaric TEKEM",
    "inquiry": "I would like to get information about enrolling "
               "in the Data and Artificial Intelligence program. "
               "Could you please provide me with the admission requirements, "
               "application process, required documents, tuition fees, "
               "and important registration deadlines?"
}

result = crew.kickoff(inputs=inputs)
